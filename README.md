# url-shortener
<br>
Made as exercise for <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/url-shortener-microservice">this FCC challenge</a>
<br>
**User Story**:  I can pass a URL as a parameter and I will receive a shortened URL in the JSON response.
<br>
**User Story**: If I pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid http://www.example.com format, the JSON response will contain an error instead.
<br>
**User Story**: When I visit that shortened URL, it will redirect me to my original link.
